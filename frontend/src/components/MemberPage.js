        Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
        bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
        book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
        it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or
        conversation?' So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she
        could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether
        the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of
        getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with
        pink eyes ran close by her...
